* year: 2014
* conf: International Conference on Machine Learning

### Short Explanation

You can get distributed representations of texts with any length by defining a vector parameter to support guessing word occurrence in the text.

### How it is better compared with prior research

Can capture the semantics of paragraphs.

### Core of method

Assumes that a vector that represent the text affects the probability of word occurrence.

### How it is evaluated

Classification of the texts

### Discussion
